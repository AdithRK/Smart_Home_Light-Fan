# Smart_Home_Light-Fan
This project uses an STM32 to demo the functionality of a  RC, Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi integrating DC LED Bulbs and  motor to  simulate  appliances like lights and fans. The appliances can be controlled via Remote, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, with their statuses displayed on an LCD/Live Expression.  Manual control using push buttons is also implemented.
